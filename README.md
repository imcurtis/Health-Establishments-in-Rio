# Health-Establishments-in-Rio

I took some lat/lon data from a dataset of health estbalishments in Rio de Janeiro and iterated through the neighborhood columns to
generate plots showing where the health facilities are in specific neighborhoods. First attempt at some good civic duty action.
Definitely welcome to more ideas, either with open/civic data or this dataset in particular.
